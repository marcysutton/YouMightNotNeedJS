// Modal is visually hidden until focused.
// This only sort-of works: you can't close
// the dialog with the escape key, and it can't
// contain anything interactive for 2 reasons: 
// you wouldn't be able to tab without blurring 
// the dialog, and they'd be focusable when 
// the dialog is closed (a poor keyboard experience).
.modal {  
  opacity: 0;
}

// modal fades in when button 
// is in focus (i.e. clicked on)
.modal:focus {
  opacity: 1;
}
